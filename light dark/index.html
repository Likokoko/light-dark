            Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic
            landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields.
            Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull
            national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital,
            Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the
            National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history

          <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeftBig">
            According to the ancient manuscript Landnámabók, the settlement of
            Iceland began in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr
            Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island.[15] In
            the following centuries, Norwegians, and to a lesser extent other
            Scandinavians, immigrated to Iceland, bringing with them thralls
            (i.e., slaves or serfs) of Gaelic origin.

            The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the
            native parliament, the Althing, one of the world's oldest
            functioning legislative assemblies. Following a period of civil
            strife, Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The
            establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of
            Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's
            integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after Sweden
            seceded from the union in 1523. The Danish kingdom forcefully
            introduced Lutheranism to Iceland in 1550.[16]

          <p class="animate__animated animate__zoomOutDown">
            In the wake of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars,
            Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in the
            Danish–Icelandic Act of Union in 1918, with the establishment of the
            Kingdom of Iceland, sharing through a personal union the incumbent
            monarch of Denmark. During the occupation of Denmark in World War
            II, Iceland voted overwhelmingly to become a republic in 1944, thus
            ending the remaining formal ties with Denmark. Although the Althing
            was suspended from 1799 to 1845, the island republic has been
            credited with sustaining the world's oldest and longest-running
            parliament.

            Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence
            fishing and agriculture. Industrialization of the fisheries and
            Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity
